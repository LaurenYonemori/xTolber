### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was my favorite because I never realized how much work went into the “spell checker” tool that we always use! I loved how this assignment made me open my eyes to the amount of thought and work that goes into seemingly simple tools/ applications/ etc  on a computer. I also loved seeing and learning how the computer communicates between the multiple files to be able to operate the program. 

*Lab 7 

    Lab 7 was another one of my favorites because I really enjoyed incorporating real world problems and using c++/coding to make our lives easier. I really enjoyed learning about what all went into such a seemingly simple program that just outputted either “allowed”,“not allowed”, or “error”. I also loved how we incorporated and got to learn more about how to use the function “bool”! 

*Lab 6 

    Lab 6 part 1 was another one of my favorite lab’s because I really loved the simple cute “Mad LIbs” type program that we made. I loved how fun it was to make and think through while also being able to try our program out and create silly little “Sandwich Orders” . This lab made me realize that you can code anything and everything.
